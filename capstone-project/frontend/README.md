# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Runs the installer to download and install all necessary packages to run the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

After starting the web app, editing the files in USMap.tsx will allow you to display different information. 

Variables:

    dataGathering - This variable controls whether you're in data gathering mode. Data gathering mode loads the map of all exits from OpenStreetMap and allows selection by rigt-clicking and dragging over an area.

    predictedRoad - This variable is the name of the file with the predicted road you'd like displayed. By default, it is pointed at path.json, the output of the pathing algorithm.

    predictedExits - This variable is the name of the file that holds the predicted exit locations you'd like displayed.  

    actualPath: This variable points at the file for the actual path of the interstate. By default it points at I680.
    actualExits: This variable points at the file for the actual exits of the interstate. By default it is the I680 exits.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
